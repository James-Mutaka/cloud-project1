## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
	cd /etc/ && ls -l shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):
	sudo chmod 600 shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
	ls -l gshadow  or ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): 
	Already set.

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
	ls -l group   or  ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): 
	sudo chmod 644 group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
	ls -l passwd   or  ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): Already set.

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): 
	sudo adduser joe  
	sudo adduser sam  
	sudo adduser amy 
	sudo adduser sara
	sudo adduser admin


2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: 
	sudo usermod -a -G sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: 
      sudo groupadd engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): 
	sudo useradd -G  engineers sam 
    	sudo useradd -G engineers joe 
	sudo useradd -G engineers amy 
	sudo useradd -G engineers sara 

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder:
	sudo mkdir /etc/engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
 	sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis:
	sudo apt-get install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
	man lynis

3. Command to run an audit:
	sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:
	sudo apt-get install chkrootkit

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
	man chkrootkit

3. Command to run expert mode:
	sudo chkrootkit -x

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
